# Producing Scrolls

The worker operator runs the writer for one library recipe at a time. The pipeline and the reasons
for its shape are in `packages/backend/src/modules/content/production/README.md`.

## Run it

The operator refuses every world except `local`, `ci`, `dev` and `stage`, before it touches the
database or the provider. The production root `scroll-supply` must be enabled in the database
(`reasoning.production_scopes`, generation 1) and in the environment.

```sh
# environment (names only; the key stays in the process environment, never on a command line)
KS_WORLD=dev DATABASE_URL=… MINIMAX_API_KEY=…
KS_REASONING_PROVIDER=minimax KS_REASONING_PRODUCTION_ENABLED=1
KS_MINIMAX_MODEL=MiniMax-M3.1-Flash          # the default for every role
KS_SCROLL_PRODUCTION_GENERATION=1            # must match the database root

node dist/operator.js content produce-scroll --topic seasons --dry-run
node dist/operator.js content produce-scroll --topic seasons
node dist/operator.js content produce-scroll --topic attention-mechanism
node dist/operator.js content produce-scroll --topic seasons --resume   # after a crash only
```

`--topic` takes a recipe key of the library plan, the record keys in
`packages/backend/src/modules/content/domain/library/` (one file per topic system). An unknown key
is refused before any database or provider work. A published Scroll gets its planet and facet
coverage from its recipe in the same transaction (D-033).

After editing the plan (a facet or planet added or reworded), decide coverage again for Scrolls that
are already published. It is idempotent and appends corrected heads only where the decision changed:

```sh
node dist/operator.js content readmit-coverage --dry-run
node dist/operator.js content readmit-coverage
```

Before a batch, check that every research page of the plan is still accepted by the fetcher and
yields a usable passage pool (it fetches slowly, about three seconds a page, because Wikipedia
rate-limits bursts):

```sh
pnpm build
node scripts/check-library-sources.mjs [--only seasons,tides]
```

The bound is **two model requests per recipe**: the writer, and at most one repair. Refusals, a
quota shortfall (`KS_MINIMAX_QUOTA_FLOOR_PERCENT`, default 25) and unknown outcomes halt the job.
Output is one JSON line with IDs, outcome codes, attempt states and token counts; never prompts,
drafts or page text. A rerun of a finished recipe reports its stored outcome. A new recipe version
(`SCROLL_PRODUCTION_VERSION`) is a new job; an old terminal job is never edited or resumed. No
provider call runs from CI. Never place keys on a command line, in logs, reports or artifacts.

`--resume` continues an unfinished job with its frozen research and the same writer run. It never
resends an attempt whose outcome is unknown: if a process may still be running, let it finish first,
then inspect with `reasoning unknown` and write the attempt off only when sure.

## When a Scroll is refused

```sh
node dist/operator.js reasoning rejected                    # newest first: attempt, step, verdict, number of findings
node dist/operator.js reasoning rejected --attempt <uuid>   # the redacted answer text and the validator's findings
```

Each refused answer of a production attempt is kept for 30 days, redacted and cut at 64 KiB, with
the same fixed findings the repair request carried (`blocks[7]: copied_passage`, …). The text is
the model's own writing about public sources; read it from an operator shell, never paste it into
an issue or a pull request. `reasoning purge-expired` removes expired ones on demand.

Usual findings and what they mean:

| Finding | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `copied_passage` | Nine words in a row match a source passage. |
| `authoring_number_not_in_evidence` | A figure (or a plotted chart value) is in no passage the block cites. |
| `too_big` / `too_small` at a field | A length limit; the finding names the field and the limit. |
| `OUTPUT_NOT_ONE_JSON_OBJECT` | The reply is not one JSON object; the detail says where it stopped being JSON. |
| `OUTPUT_TRUNCATED` | The reply hit the token ceiling, usually because the model thought too long. |
| `reading_length_out_of_brief` | Under two or over eight minutes of reading. |
| `MODEL_MISMATCH` (attempt code) | The route answered with another model than the configured one. |

## Facts about the model

`MiniMax-M3.1-Flash` thinks before it answers and refuses `thinking: disabled`; thinking tokens
count against `max_tokens`. Without a hint it can think for the whole budget and never answer, so
the writer asks for `medium` effort and a 16,000-token ceiling. Its replies are plain text JSON.
Unknown model names are silently served by another model; the adapter checks the reply's `model`.
Quota: `GET https://www.minimax.io/v1/token_plan/remains`, entry `general`.

## Research

Policy `public-research.v1`: individually reviewed HTTPS hosts, default port, no URL
credentials/query/hash, no cookies, manual redirects (at most three) with every URL and DNS answer
rechecked, public addresses only, identity encoding only, at most 2 MiB of HTML, bounded plain-text
extraction, soft-404 refusal. Code chooses the pages; the model never does. Snapshots stay private
in the nonpersonal production row.

## Evidence for acceptance

Label what a result is: source inspection, CI fixture, real database, real provider, browser or
device, dev or stage deployment. A generated Scroll counts only after it is published through this
pipeline and read in the connected app; a fixture publication does not establish it. Human review
notes cover accuracy, clarity, the interactive block, unsupported inference and where an analogy
stops.
