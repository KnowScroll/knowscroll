# modules/content

Shared, immutable content: assets, their admitted revisions, and the internal provenance each
revision rests on. **Content is not personal data**: no table here has a `universe_id` or an account
column, none is in the erasure registry (clearing a universe, a privacy reset or deleting an account
leaves it), and nothing here records who read what.

## Tables

| Table | Migration | Holds | Erasure |
|---|---|---|---|
| `content.assets` | `0003_content_assets` | Asset identity, `kind` (`reel`/`scroll`), `status` (`admitted`/`withdrawn`) and the **current** revision | None: shared content |
| `content.asset_revisions` | `0010_content_asset_revisions` | One immutable row per admitted revision: `provenance_kind` (`authored_editorial` · `generated` · `cutroom_import`, D-005), the consumer document (`document_version`, `document`, `document_sha256`), `explanation_unit_id`, `language`, `title`, and the derived `reading_facts` | None: shared content |
| `content.asset_provenance` | `0010_content_asset_revisions` | The internal provenance of a revision (claims, sources, bindings, checks, production record). Written by admission, **read by no API route**: the consumer document and its provenance are separate tables, so no read of the document can return them | None: shared content |
| `content.scroll_production_runs` | `0015_scroll_production` | Private nonpersonal topic/version jobs, frozen research/passages, accepted claims, code-only outcomes, draft and publication pointer; no consumer read port | None: shared public supply |

A revision’s document, provenance and identity are never updated; a content change is a new revision, and anything that rests on one (an exposure,
a saved item) keeps pointing at exactly the bytes it presented.

The storage adapter validates derived reading facts against the canonical Scroll block registry. Domain facts stay plain data; evidence checks declared interactions through content’s framework-free public predicate, without importing renderer schemas into domain/application code.

## Use cases and ports

| Operation | Caller | Authority, effects, failure |
|---|---|---|
| `importEditorialScroll(source)` | Operator command `dist/operator.js content import-editorial --file <path>` | Allow-listed worlds only (`dev`, `stage`, `ci`, `local`; the command refuses elsewhere before touching the database). One transaction serialised per asset (advisory lock): compile the source at the current revision and compare the integrity hash (equal → refresh derived reading facts if needed (`facts_refreshed`), otherwise `unchanged`); otherwise compile at the next revision number and store the revision, its provenance and the asset's new current revision together (`created` / `revised`). Compilation is scroll-model's **admission** path (staged draft checks, honesty rules, copy check, code-set measures, integrity hash) followed by `admitDocument` on exactly the stored bytes. Refusals (`source_invalid`, `compile_refused` with `stage` and issue codes and paths, `asset_is_not_a_scroll`, `asset_withdrawn`) write nothing and never echo source text. |
| `FindOpenableAsset` (token `FIND_OPENABLE_ASSET`) | experience | The asset's kind, current revision, status and the document hash, inside the caller's personal transaction, no lock |
| `ReadScrollReadingFacts` (token `READ_SCROLL_READING_FACTS`) | experience, evidence | The block weights and types, the owner of each nested block and the reading estimate of one stored Scroll revision, derived at admission from the document's code-set measures and validated on read. Old facts versions are derived from the immutable admitted document on read until re-import persists the current view; unsupported stored documents raise `READING_FACTS_REQUIRES_REFRESH` rather than masquerading as a lineage mismatch |
| `RenderScroll` (token `RENDER_SCROLL`) | experience | Reads the stored consumer document (never provenance), parses it on the client path, and **negotiates** it for the capabilities the client declared (D-012): unsupported blocks become readable fallbacks, essential ones are reported. Parsed documents are cached (immutable, 32 entries) |
| `FindAssetForAction` (token `FIND_ASSET_FOR_ACTION`) | experience actions | Does the asset exist, is it admitted, at which revision |

`adapters/cutroom/wire-v1/` is the byte-for-byte vendored Cutroom wire schema (CF-61): not built,
linted or formatted; verified by the `integrity` CI job.

## The starter Scroll (D-005)

`starter/why-the-sky-is-blue.editorial-scroll.json` is one original, authored explainer in
`scroll-document.v1` producer form (an `editorial-scroll.v1` source: publication facts, the authored
`scroll-draft.v1`, no claims because it states no digits). It is labelled `authored_editorial` (the
production record is set by code from the file's `reference`, so an authored piece can never claim to
be model-written) and is never presented as generated. Seven sections, text-family blocks only
(subheading, paragraph, list, quote, callout, disclosure), about four minutes. The build emits the JSON
next to the compiled code: in a release tree it is at
`node_modules/@knowscroll/backend/dist/modules/content/starter/why-the-sky-is-blue.editorial-scroll.json`.
`content/` at the repository root is frozen v1 data and is never read.

Jobs: none. Lock order: an advisory lock on the asset ID, then the asset row; admission holds no personal
root and never takes one. Erasure: none (shared content; stated above).

`reading_facts.v2` is a refreshable derived view, separate from immutable document/provenance bytes. Re-importing an unchanged source repairs it under the asset admission lock without creating a revision.

## Approved Cutroom reuse and Reel media (S2.4, #233)

The worker operator `content import-cutroom-reel --run <uuid> --script <name>` imports only the
three D-005 approved runs (greenhouse, seasons-v5, tides-v4). Their original script/approval snapshots
and coordinator-read media digest/size pins are kept under `approved/`; frozen root `content/` is never
read or edited. `legacy-cutroom-<script>` is the shared explanation identity of Reel and future Scroll
siblings. GET-only loopback reads use the actual pinned upstream parsers, compiled to JS at build;
no commissioning, resume, cancel, model, quota, money or provider adapter exists here.

Import validates terminal/run/request identities, every chosen/used engine check and shot/degradation
coverage, then opens a contained regular engine artifact, stream-stages, hashes, ffprobes H264/AAC
portrait 24fps 48kHz stereo/20–60s/faststart, installs bytes, and commits an immutable revision with
internal provenance in one short admission transaction. No network, media copy or probe is inside that
transaction. Nonfixture imports must match the frozen approved SHA-256 and size; a repeated run is
unchanged. Engine witness evidence is labelled **engine-attested, not independent**. Absolute paths
are neither documents nor diagnostics; captions are burned into the real approved MP4s.

Migration `0014_media_reels` adds shared `media_objects` (logical key/backend/checksum/size/MIME/revision/
probe) and `reel_imports` (run → immutable revision/media). Shared data is retained across personal reset.
`--fixture` is accepted only in `ci`/`local`, and a DB trigger additionally confines fixture rows to
`ks_it_*`/`knowscroll_fixture_*` disposable databases. Fixture titles/documents are explicitly labelled.

The API reads media only through a caller-owned exposure at its live privacy epoch and an admitted
asset. The consumer `reel-document.v1` contains logical media keys, title/summary/duration/dimensions and
truth/fixture/caption labels; internal production/checks/approvals never appear in it. Media grants are
separate ephemeral access credentials, never content provenance or consumption evidence.

## Generated Scroll production

The worker's `content produce-scroll --topic seasons|tides|greenhouse [--dry-run] [--resume]`
uses content-owned claims/writer roles through the explicit nonpersonal harness (0013), never a
personal universe. Both roles put code checks inside the harness's single repair boundary: at most
four model requests per topic, with uncertain attempts never resent. Publication closes the writer
run and stores the immutable admitted revision in the same production-root transaction. Research
and model waits happen outside it. The same version reruns idempotently; explicit resume continues
frozen stages after a crash. See [production/README.md](production/README.md) and the
[operator runbook](../../../../../docs/v2/operations/scroll-production.md). Fixture CI and real
provider/browser evidence are separate requirements; no authored starter is labelled generated.
