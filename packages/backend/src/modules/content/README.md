# modules/content

Shared, immutable content: assets, their admitted revisions, and the internal provenance each
revision rests on. **Content is not personal data**: no table here has a `universe_id` or an account
column, none is in the erasure registry (clearing a universe, a privacy reset or deleting an account
leaves it), and nothing here records who read what.

## Tables

| Table | Migration | Holds | Erasure |
|---|---|---|---|
| `content.assets` | `0003_content_assets` | Asset identity, `kind` (`reel`/`scroll`), `status` (`admitted`/`withdrawn`) and the **current** revision | None: shared content |
| `content.asset_revisions` | `0010_content_asset_revisions` | One immutable row per admitted revision: `provenance_kind` (`authored_editorial` · `generated` · `cutroom_import`, D-005), the consumer document (`document_version`, `document`, `document_sha256`), `explanation_unit_id`, `language`, `title`, and the derived `reading_facts` | None: shared content |
| `content.asset_provenance` | `0010_content_asset_revisions` | The internal provenance of a revision (claims, sources, bindings, checks, production record). Written by admission, **read by no API route**: the consumer document and its provenance are separate tables, so no read of the document can return them | None: shared content |

A revision’s document, provenance and identity are never updated; a content change is a new revision, and anything that rests on one (an exposure,
a saved item) keeps pointing at exactly the bytes it presented.

## Use cases and ports

| Operation | Caller | Authority, effects, failure |
|---|---|---|
| `importEditorialScroll(source)` | Operator command `dist/operator.js content import-editorial --file <path>` | Allow-listed worlds only (`dev`, `stage`, `ci`, `local`; the command refuses elsewhere before touching the database). One transaction serialised per asset (advisory lock): compile the source at the current revision and compare the integrity hash (equal → refresh derived reading facts if needed (`facts_refreshed`), otherwise `unchanged`); otherwise compile at the next revision number and store the revision, its provenance and the asset's new current revision together (`created` / `revised`). Compilation is scroll-model's **admission** path (staged draft checks, honesty rules, copy check, code-set measures, integrity hash) followed by `admitDocument` on exactly the stored bytes. Refusals (`source_invalid`, `compile_refused` with `stage` and issue codes and paths, `asset_is_not_a_scroll`, `asset_withdrawn`) write nothing and never echo source text. |
| `FindOpenableAsset` (token `FIND_OPENABLE_ASSET`) | experience | The asset's kind, current revision, status and the document hash, inside the caller's personal transaction, no lock |
| `ReadScrollReadingFacts` (token `READ_SCROLL_READING_FACTS`) | experience, evidence | The block weights and types, the owner of each nested block and the reading estimate of one stored Scroll revision, derived at admission from the document's code-set measures and validated on read. Old facts versions are derived from the immutable admitted document on read until re-import persists the current view; unsupported stored documents raise `READING_FACTS_REQUIRES_REFRESH` rather than masquerading as a lineage mismatch |
| `RenderScroll` (token `RENDER_SCROLL`) | experience | Reads the stored consumer document (never provenance), parses it on the client path, and **negotiates** it for the capabilities the client declared (D-012): unsupported blocks become readable fallbacks, essential ones are reported. Parsed documents are cached (immutable, 32 entries) |
| `FindAssetForAction` (token `FIND_ASSET_FOR_ACTION`) | experience actions | Does the asset exist, is it admitted, at which revision |

`adapters/cutroom/wire-v1/` is the byte-for-byte vendored Cutroom wire schema (CF-61): not built,
linted or formatted; verified by the `integrity` CI job.

## The starter Scroll (D-005)

`starter/why-the-sky-is-blue.editorial-scroll.json` is one original, authored explainer in
`scroll-document.v1` producer form (an `editorial-scroll.v1` source: publication facts, the authored
`scroll-draft.v1`, no claims because it states no digits). It is labelled `authored_editorial` (the
production record is set by code from the file's `reference`, so an authored piece can never claim to
be model-written) and is never presented as generated. Seven sections, text-family blocks only
(subheading, paragraph, list, quote, callout, disclosure), about four minutes. The build emits the JSON
next to the compiled code: in a release tree it is at
`node_modules/@knowscroll/backend/dist/modules/content/starter/why-the-sky-is-blue.editorial-scroll.json`.
`content/` at the repository root is frozen v1 data and is never read.

Jobs: none. Lock order: an advisory lock on the asset ID, then the asset row; admission holds no personal
root and never takes one. Erasure: none (shared content; stated above).

`reading_facts.v2` is a refreshable derived view, separate from immutable document/provenance bytes. Re-importing an unchanged source repairs it under the asset admission lock without creating a revision.
